PLEASE NOTE: Both possible formats of the state.json file are given
here (as the filenames stateScheduling.json and stateMatching.json).
Rename each of these two files to state.json and give 2 output files:
one for scheduling and one for matching.

For example, you can call them outputScheduling.json and outputMatching.json
